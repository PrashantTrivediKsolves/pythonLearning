# Regular function


def square(x):
    return x * x
print(square(4))  # Output: 16



#  Same using lambda

square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(4))  # Output: 16


# They behave the same â€” but the lambda is more compact.



#  Syntax Breakdown:

lambda x, y: x + y

# This creates a function that:

# takes 2 arguments (x and y)

# returns their sum (x + y)


sum = lambda x,y,z = 4 : x + y

print(sum(2,4))
